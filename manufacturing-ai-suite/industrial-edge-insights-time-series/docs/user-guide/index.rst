Industrial Edge Insights – Time Series
======================================

Industrial Edge Insights – Time Series sample apps provides AI-powered, real-time monitoring for anomaly detection in industrial environments. These sample applications showcase how advanced analytics at the edge can drive operational efficiency, reduce downtime, and improve safety.

Overview
--------

The suite includes two sample applications, each leveraging a common architecture with configurations tailored to specific industrial scenarios:

- **Wind Turbine Anomaly Detection**
- **Weld Anomaly Detection**

Wind Turbine Anomaly Detection
------------------------------

In the Energy Sector, such as wind turbines for power generation, unexpected equipment
failures result in costly downtime and operational inefficiencies. Using AI-driven
predictive analytics, edge devices can monitor equipment health through sensor data
(For example, power generation and wind speed), detect anomalous trends indicative of
wear or failure, and alert operators to schedule maintenance proactively. This enhances
productivity, reduces costs, and extends equipment lifespan.

This sample application demonstrates a time series use case by detecting the anomalous
power generation patterns relative to wind speed. By identifying deviations, it helps
optimize maintenance schedules and prevent potential turbine failures, enhancing
operational efficiency.

Weld Anomaly Detection
----------------------

Maintaining weld quality is critical for safety and reliability in manufacturing. 
Unexpected weld defects or process deviations can result in failures, hazards, and 
unplanned downtime. Leveraging AI-driven analytics, edge devices monitor weld sensor data 
to detect anomalous weld patterns and alert operators for timely intervention. 
This enables proactive maintenance, improves safety, and increases operational efficiency.
